# About

I build and evaluate agentic LLM systems that stay grounded, safe, and useful for real users. My background spans English philology, linguistics, and language technology, so I blend humanistic thinking with practical engineering.

## What I work on

- LLM evaluation with judge models, safety/quality gates, and human feedback.
- Agent frameworks combining tools, retrieval, and memory for robust workflows.
- Creative NLG for games (RPG-GPT) and local/offline RAG experiences (Relics).

## Perspective

- Bias-aware by design: deploying AI responsibly matters as much as raw metrics.
- User-centric: evaluation has to reflect real tasks, not just benchmarks.
- Practical: productionizing models with observability beats leaderboard chasing.

## Community & volunteering

- President & founder, HELdance ry (2019-2022).
- Panelist on gender bias in machine translation (Goethe-Institut & SKTL, 2022).
- Sound design roles in Humanistispeksi productions (2018-2020).
