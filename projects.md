# Projects

## Highlights

- First author: "Multilingual Persuasion Detection: Video Games as an Invaluable Data Source for NLP" (DiGRA 2022). Built a multilingual persuasion dataset from RPG dialogue (EN/ES/DE/FR/IT) and compared mono vs. multilingual BERT models; 12 citations.
- Master's thesis: RPG-GPT - creative dialogue for RPG NPCs by fine-tuning GODEL and running user studies on relevance and engagement.
- Invited panelist, "Gender Correct?" (Goethe-Institut and SKTL) on gender bias in translation; wrote the accompanying article for SKTL magazine.

## Relics (2024)

Local LLM game dialogue system with an on-device RAG pipeline. Runs fully on the player's machine to keep latency low and protect user privacy. Built as part of Espoo Game Lab; included retrieval design, prompt routing, and evaluation of story coherence.

## RPG-GPT (Master's thesis, 2023)

Creative NLG for RPG NPCs. Extracted dialogue from popular RPGs and fine-tuned Microsoft's GODEL to act as an "RPG chatbot." Conducted a user study on relevance and engagement; found that task-oriented game dialogue (TOGD) with external knowledge improves player experience.

## Multilingual Persuasion Detection (DiGRA 2022)

First-author paper with a multilingual persuasion dataset from RPG dialogue (EN, ES, DE, FR, IT). Compared monolingual vs. multilingual BERT models, showing strong gains from domain-aligned monolingual models. Released data and models openly (12 citations).

## Multi-label text classification (Reuters, 126 labels)

Course project using RoBERTa with `BCEWithLogitsLoss` and class weighting to handle severe imbalance. Achieved macro F1 0.61 (micro F1 0.77) on the dev set; 2nd out of 9 teams. [Report](/assets/documents/idl_project_report.pdf)

## Diachronic embeddings for semantic change (Bachelor's thesis)

Trained TWEC-based diachronic embeddings on Reddit (2006-2019) to analyze semantic shift. PCA visualizations showed metaphorical change (e.g., "toxic" moving from chemical to social contexts). [Thesis PDF](/assets/documents/ba_thesis_teemu_poyhonen.pdf)

## Early work

- Word Sense Disambiguation with a Naive Bayes classifier on Senseval2.
- TF-IDF proverb search engine with stemming and meaning-based search.
