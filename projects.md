# Projects

Here is a collection of my most important projects.

## [Word Sense Disambiguation](https://github.com/Teemursu/teemursu.github.io/blob/master/dd%20(6)%20(10)%20(2).ipynb)

My first machine learning system built for "Machine Learning for Linguists" course. I used the naive Bayes classifier to disambiguate between words hard, interest, serve and line. As my data, I used the Senseval 2 corpus.

## [Proverb Search Engine (TFIDF)](https://github.com/aarniolaura/schwas/tree/master/Final_project)

This search engine uses TFIDF to search for proverbs. Data was first gathered using BeautifulSoup from various websites (mostly from phrases.org.uk). The search engine has stemming, and can also search by meaning of the phrase. This is done by searching the definitions of all proverbs.

I'm hoping to soon host this application on a site like Heroku, but I'm having some difficulties with it.

## [BA Thesis: Diachronic Word Embeddings to Research Semantic Change](https://github.com/Teemursu/reddit_neologism_semantic_change)

I'm currently working on this, and I will update more details later. Feel free to ask me about my thesis if it interests you!
