Founder of [HELdance ry](https://www.facebook.com/HELdanceCrew/), linguist, [skater](https://www.instagram.com/longteemu/), a geek and a beat maker.

I want to help computers understand language. 

Studying NLP, lexical semantics and Transformers architecture.
- Helsinki University - Master's programme: Linguistic Diversity & Digital Humanities - Language Technology track

I'm driven by analyzing and mitigating cultural biases from AI and NLP. Currently, I'm taking part of a research project on Multilingual/Finnish gender bias in word embeddings (both static and contextual.)
