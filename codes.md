# Weekly workload calculator

This simple calculator first tells you how much time one credit point (ECTS) corresponds to. Then, it will ask you how many credit points the user's course is, and then the length of the course (in weeks). With these inputs, the calculator will tell the user how many hours and minutes a week the user needs to work to complete the course.
