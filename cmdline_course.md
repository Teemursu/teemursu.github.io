## The course in a nutshell

The command-line course teaches students to operate in a Unix enviornment. 

For the purpose of going through the content of the course and what I learned from it, I will introduce the weekly themes and go through them in order

## Week 1: Introduction to Command-Line Environments

During the first week we learned some basics on the Unix environment commands and file types. For instance, I learned about binary and non-binary files, commands like cp, touch and cat, as well as about the - (slash) sign which modifies the behavior of Linux shell commands.

## Week 2: Navigating a UNIX System

This week I learned about file permissions and the root user, symbolic links, and processes.

## Week 3: Corpus processing

For this week I studied how to process and analyse text files by using commands such as grep -E. 

## Week 4: Scripting and UNIX Configuration Files

Next, I learned about scripting. For example, I got to customize my own .bashrc file.

This was the most difficult week for me, as it felt like I sohuld have had at least some practice or familiarity with scripting before. 

## Week 5: Installing and Running Programs

For the second to last week I learned about commands such as make. Additionally, while I already had some familarity with Python from another course, I felt like I got a deeper understanding about what exactly pip is.


## Week 6: Version Control

During this last week, I got to prepare for the final assignment of the course (which basically is this page). I have visited github before, and occasionally downloaded files from github, but I never really knew what it was, or how version control works.
